## System Architecture

### Overview
DevOps Simulator follows an **event-driven microservices architecture** with AI/ML integration, designed for multi-cloud deployments and chaos engineering.

### Components

#### 1. Application Server
- Technology: Node.js + Express + TensorFlow.js
- Ports: 9000 (main), 9001 (metrics), 9002 (AI API)
- Scaling: AI-powered predictive auto-scaling
- Intelligence: Real-time ML inference
- Message Queue: Apache Kafka for event streaming

#### 2. Database Layer
- Primary: PostgreSQL 14 cluster (5 nodes)
- Cache: Redis cluster with ML-based cache optimization
- Configuration: Multi-master replication
- Backup: Continuous backup with geo-redundancy
- AI Features: Query optimization, index suggestions

#### 3. AI/ML Pipeline
- Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn
- Models: Anomaly detection (LSTM), Load prediction (XGBoost), Auto-scaling optimizer
- Training: Continuous online learning
- Inference: Real-time predictions (<50ms latency)

#### 4. Multi-Cloud Orchestration
- Clouds: AWS, Azure, GCP, DigitalOcean
- Orchestrator: Kubernetes with custom CRDs
- Load Balancing: Global anycast with GeoDNS
